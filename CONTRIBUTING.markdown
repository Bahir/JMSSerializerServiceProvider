Hey there, how nice of you to dedicate some time to making this provider even better! Obviously we are more than happy with every contribution, how little it may be. However, there are a few guidelines that will help us to merge your input even faster. Please take these into account.

1. For starters, all pull requests should be send to the `develop`. Please don't edit the `VERSION` file.
2. When modifying composer configuration, please update the `composer.lock` file as well.

Thanks for your effort, it's much appreciated!
